# Workshop optimization
This mod stops the `Portable Workshop` from moving its stash to player inventory.  
This way the lag upon opening/closing the workbench of the portable workshop is completely eliminated.

## Planned
- Either move tools (Gunsmithing, Drug making kit etc...) to player inventory or find a way to "register" them to the workshop too.  
I think I will just move those to player inventory since that has 0 overhead and is much easier to do.
- Clean up files/code.

## Installation
This mod overwrites files from `SixSloth's & Veerserif's Hideout Furnitures 2.2.1 GAMMA patch`, so make sure that the priority is set higher than that of the mentioned mod/patch.
